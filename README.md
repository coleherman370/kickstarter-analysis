# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analysis of Kickstarter fundraising data.

### Purpose
Analyze the success rates of Kickstarter fundraiser categorized by Theater and Plays.

## Analysis and Challenges
Fundraisers for Theater have a fairly even split of successful and failed rates. There appears to be a peak success time of the year. If a Theater fundraiser is launched in the Spring time, it has a much higher chance of success than if launched in the Winter season. ![This trend can be seen in this chart.](https://github.com/coleherman370/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Theater_outcomes_vs_Launch.png) Another common trend among fundraising specifically for Plays is that as the goal increases, the success rate decreases. There appears to be to sweet spot for fundraisers with goals between $30k and $40 ![as seen here.](https://github.com/coleherman370/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) However, it more likely that this jump in success rate corresponds more with there being a small sample size within this goal range rather than actual upwards trend. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
See comment and first link above.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
See comment and second link above.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For a deeper analysis of Theater trends, the genre could be considered. Perhaps the cause for these current trends between successful/failed rates have less correspondence with the target goal than correspondence with whether the play is a musical vs drama. That data is not available in the current set making such analysis impossible at this time.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 - Overall enthusiam for Theater Kickstarter appears to be highest in the Spring time. Winter is has the fewest overall fundraisers for Theater.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 - Success rates decrease as fundraising goals increase. Most of the fundraisers have lower goals making the trends in the higher goal ranges less reliable as an overall trend.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 - We do not have data on Genre of Theater/Play. This means that we cannot determine if the success rates are being driven more by interest in Musicals vs Dramas.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 - Viewing the Theater Outcomes by Year would be a useful table to see if there is a trend of interest occurring over a period of time. Charting the data by a range of days between Launch Date to Deadline would be useful to see if the fundraising term is influencing the success rate. Charting the success by Country to determine whether or not there's an overall trend of interest by country. It's possible that the US with a pop 360m has significantly more Theater fundraisers but GB with a pop of only 67m has higher success rate among their Theater fundraisers.
